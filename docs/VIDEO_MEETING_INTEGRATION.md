- Pay-per-minute pricing
- Good for custom branding

**Agora SDK:**
- Enterprise-grade performance

**Custom WebRTC:**
- Full control over implementation
- Most complex but most flexible
- Requires significant development time

## 🚀 Current Implementation: Jitsi Meet

We've implemented **Jitsi Meet** as the primary video solution because it provides the best balance of features, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness.

### Features Available Now:

**Meeting Controls:**
- ✅ Join/leave meeting with one click
- ✅ Mute/unmute audio and video
- ✅ Fullscreen mode
- ✅ Participant count display
- ✅ Meeting status indicators

**Integration Features:**
- ✅ Automatic meeting status updates (Scheduled → In Progress → Completed)
- ✅ Real-time participant tracking
- ✅ Seamless integration with meeting details
- ✅ Mobile responsive interface

**Built-in Jitsi Features:**
- Screen sharing
- Text chat during meetings
- Recording capabilities
- Virtual backgrounds
- Raise hand functionality
- Device selection (camera/microphone)
- Network quality indicators

### How It Works:

1. **Room Generation**: Each meeting gets a unique room ID based on the meeting UUID
2. **User Authentication**: Participants join with their name and email from the platform
3. **Status Sync**: Meeting status automatically updates when participants join/leave
4. **Embedded Experience**: Video calling happens directly in the meeting detail page

### Example Usage:

```typescript
// The VideoMeeting component is already integrated
<VideoMeeting 
  meeting={meeting} 
  onMeetingStart={() => console.log('Meeting started')}
  onMeetingEnd={() => console.log('Meeting ended')}
/>
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components:
- `VideoMeeting.tsx` - Main Jitsi integration component
- `ZoomMeeting.tsx` - Template for Zoom SDK integration
- Meeting detail page with video tab
- Join meeting buttons in meeting lists

### Backend Integration:
- Meeting status updates via API
- Participant tracking
- Meeting lifecycle management
- Audit logging for meeting events

### Database Schema:
The existing meeting schema supports video integration:
```sql
Meeting {
  id: String (used for room generation)
  title: String (displayed in video interface)
  status: MeetingStatus (updated during video calls)
  startTime/endTime: DateTime (meeting scheduling)
  attendees: MeetingAttendee[] (participant management)
}
```

## 📱 User Experience

### For Meeting Organizers:
1. Schedule meeting normally through the platform
2. Add attendees, agenda, and details
3. When meeting time arrives, click "🎥 Join Meeting"
4. Video interface loads with meeting controls
5. Meeting automatically marked as "In Progress"

### For Meeting Attendees:
1. Receive meeting invitation/notification
2. Click meeting link or navigate to meeting page
3. Click "🎥 Join Meeting" tab
4. Join video call with single click
5. No separate app or account required

### Mobile Experience:
- Fully responsive video interface
- Touch-friendly controls
- Automatic mobile optimization by Jitsi
- Works in mobile browsers

## 🛠 Customization Options

### Jitsi Configuration:
You can customize the Jitsi experience by modifying `VideoMeeting.tsx`:

```typescript
const jitsiConfig = {
  configOverwrite: {
    startWithAudioMuted: false,
    startWithVideoMuted: false,
    // Add your customizations here
  },
  interfaceConfigOverwrite: {
    APP_NAME: 'Your App Name',
    TOOLBAR_BUTTONS: [...], // Customize toolbar
    // Add your branding
  }
}
```

### Self-Hosting Jitsi:
To use your own Jitsi server instead of meet.jit.si:

1. Set up Jitsi Meet server
2. Update the `domain` variable in `VideoMeeting.tsx`
3. Configure your server settings

```typescript
// Change this line in VideoMeeting.tsx
const domain = 'your-jitsi-domain.com';
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Jitsi Meet:
- Meetings are password-protected by room ID
- Only meeting participants (with meeting ID) can join
- No data stored on external servers when self-hosted
- End-to-end encryption available in self-hosted setups

### Zoom SDK:
- Enterprise-grade security
- Waiting rooms and passwords supported  
- Advanced admin controls
- Compliance with enterprise security standards

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### Current Tracking:
- Meeting start/end times
- Participant join/leave events
- Meeting status changes
- Audit logs for all meeting events

### Possible Enhancements:
- Meeting duration tracking
- Participant engagement metrics
- Recording management
- Usage analytics dashboard

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Immediate Use:
1. Your Jitsi integration is ready to use now!
2. Navigate to any meeting and try the "🎥 Join Meeting" tab
3. No additional setup required

### For Zoom Integration:
1. Follow the setup steps in the Zoom section above
