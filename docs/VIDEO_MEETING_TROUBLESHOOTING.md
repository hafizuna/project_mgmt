# Video Meeting Troubleshooting Guide

## üîß Recent Fixes Applied (Sept 16, 2025)

### Authentication Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: `conference.connectionError.membersOnly` and "Waiting for authenticated user"
- **Solution**: Enhanced Jitsi configuration to bypass lobby restrictions
- **Changes Made**:
  - Disabled all lobby-related features (`enableLobby: false`, `disableLobby: true`)
  - Removed authentication requirements completely
  - Generated unique room names to avoid conflicts
  - Disabled moderator features that trigger authentication

### Video Display Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Video showing only 25% of container with white space
- **Solution**: Enhanced CSS targeting and iframe configuration
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added comprehensive CSS targeting all Jitsi video containers
  - Fixed iframe sizing with proper height/width attributes
  - Enhanced video layout configuration (`VIDEO_LAYOUT_FIT: 'contain'`)
  - Added proper background colors to eliminate white space

## üéØ Current Configuration

### Jitsi Meeting Settings
```typescript
configOverwrite: {
  // Authentication completely disabled
  enableAuthByDomain: false,
  authenticationRequired: false,
  enableGuestsAuthorization: false,
  
  // Lobby features disabled
  enableLobby: false,
  enableLobbyChat: false,
  enableAutoKnocking: false,
  enableKnocking: false,
  disableLobby: true,
  
  // Video quality settings
  constraints: {
    video: {
      height: { ideal: 720, max: 1080, min: 240 }
    }
  },
  resolution: 720,
  
  // Security settings
  enableE2EE: false,
  disableModerator: true
}
```

### CSS Fixes Applied
- Target all Jitsi video containers: `.large-video-container`, `#largeVideoContainer`, `.videocontainer`
- Force minimum height of 700px across all video elements
- Remove padding/margins that create white space
- Set proper background colors and object-fit properties

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. "Waiting for Authenticated User" Message
**This is NORMAL behavior** and usually resolves automatically within 10-30 seconds.

What this message means:
- **Single User**: You're the first person to join - Jitsi is setting you up as the moderator
- **Multiple Users**: You're waiting for the first person to become moderator
- **Not an Error**: The meeting will start automatically once moderator is established

**What to do**:
- ‚úÖ Wait 10-30 seconds - it usually resolves automatically
- ‚úÖ Try refreshing the page if it takes too long
- ‚úÖ Have another person join the meeting to trigger moderator assignment
- ‚úÖ Check that your camera/microphone permissions are granted

### 2. Still Getting "Members Only" Error
If you still see authentication errors:
- Clear browser cache completely
- Try using an incognito/private browser window
- Check if your network/firewall is blocking WebRTC
- Room names are now generated with timestamp + random ID to avoid conflicts

### 2. Video Still Not Full Size
If video doesn't fill the container:
- Check browser developer tools for CSS conflicts
- Ensure the parent container has proper height set
- The CSS targets multiple Jitsi classes - it may take a moment to apply
- Try refreshing the page after joining

### 3. No Video/Audio Access
If camera/microphone don't work:
- Grant permissions when browser prompts
- Check browser settings for camera/microphone access
- Ensure no other applications are using the camera
- Try refreshing and re-granting permissions

## üìã Testing Checklist

### Before Each Meeting Test:
- [ ] Meeting loads (may show "waiting for authenticated user" initially - this is normal)
- [ ] Authentication waiting resolves within 10-30 seconds
- [ ] Video container takes full 700px height
- [ ] Camera and microphone work properly
- [ ] No white space around video
- [ ] Meeting controls (mute, camera, share) work
- [ ] Meeting can be shared via the share button

### If Issues Persist:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify network connectivity and WebRTC support
3. Test with a different browser
4. Clear browser cache and cookies
5. Check if corporate firewall is blocking video calls

## üîÑ Room Name Generation

The system now generates unique room names using:
- Meeting ID (first 6 characters)
- Random identifier (6 characters)
- Timestamp (last 6 digits)

Format: `pf{meetingId}{randomId}{timestamp}`
Example: `pfabc123xyz789456123`

This ensures each meeting gets a truly unique room that won't conflict with existing restricted rooms.

## üé® Visual Improvements

### Share Meeting Feature
- Added share button in both meeting controls and meeting detail header
- Uses native Web Share API when available
- Falls back to clipboard copy with user feedback
- Works on both desktop and mobile devices

### Enhanced UI
- Improved loading states and connection feedback
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages
- Cleaner meeting controls interface
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## üì± Mobile Considerations

The video meeting works on mobile devices with:
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive layout
- Native share functionality
- Proper viewport scaling

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with the new configuration
2. **Monitor logs** for any remaining authentication issues
3. **Consider self-hosting Jitsi** for complete control if issues persist
4. **Implement user feedback** collection for meeting quality

## üìû Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all recent changes are deployed
3. Test with multiple users in the same meeting
4. Consider implementing fallback to external meeting links

The current implementation should resolve both the authentication and video display issues you were experiencing.
